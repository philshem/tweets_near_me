#### Red marker indicates search location. Blue markers are all geo-enabled tweets in the past 7 days that are within search radius (1 km in this case)

**Requirements:**

1. Create authentication parameters for the [Twitter REST API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public) and add them to your *config.py* file
2. Modify the *config.py* file to include your address

        my_address = 'Technoparkstrasse 1, 8005 ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland'   
  
  Or your latitude/longitude
  
       my_latlong = [47.3901151,8.5151409]

3. Add specific search terms to *config.py*. Only geo-enabled tweets will be returned
 
         searchlist = ['dataviz','opendata'] 
 
4. Generate tweets.html file by running `python tweets_near_me.py`
5. To view HTML page, navigate with command prompt to the folder containing tweets.html, and start simple web server:
  
          python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

6. With browser, visit page [http://localhost:8000/tweets.html](http://localhost:8000/tweets.html)
